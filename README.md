## üìå What This Project Does

This project is not just a simple price predictor ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **comprehensive real estate analytics tool**.

### **1. Price Prediction Engine**
- Uses a **Random Forest Regressor** from **scikit-learn** trained on property data with **20+ features**.
- Incorporates **vectorization techniques** to convert categorical and text features into numerical form.
- Inputs considered include:
  - Location (sector)
  - Number of bedrooms, bathrooms
  - Super built-up area
  - Furnishing status
  - Age of property
  - Amenities and more
- Predicts estimated property price instantly.

### **2. Interactive Data Analysis**
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for detailed statistical charts.
- **Plotly** for interactive plots (hover, zoom, filter).
- Sector-wise **price trends** and **feature correlation** visualizations.
- Geographical mapping of properties for better location insights.
